# Mug.js
Mug.js is a full stack web framework written entirely in JavaScript.  It strives to be as fast as possible while implementing as much useful features as possible.  It does all the hard stuff in the background so you can focus on making your website better and more efficient!

**MUG.JS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!!** It may not have all the features that you'd like in a web framework *or* it might not function correctly.  If you experience any bugs or want to suggest any features, please create an [issue](https://github.com/zackenstien/mugjs/issues/new) and I'll get on it asap!

## Features
- Routing (including easy redirecting)
- Controllers
